          Foundation is set in the future, when the world is barely remembered,
          and humans have colonized the galaxy. The book introduces Hari Seldon,
          a brilliant visionary and psychohistorian whose job is to use
          mathematics and probability to predict the future

          The book is set in 1984 in Oceania, one of three perpetually warring
          totalitarian states (the other two are Eurasia and Eastasia). Oceania
          is governed by the all-controlling Party, which has brainwashed the
          population into unthinking obedience to its leader, Big Brother. The
          Party has created a propagandistic language known as Newspeak, which
          is designed to limit free thought and promote the Party’s doctrines.
          Its words include doublethink (belief in contradictory ideas
          simultaneously), which is reflected in the Party’s slogans: “War is
          peace,” “Freedom is slavery,” and “Ignorance is strength.” The Party
          maintains control through the Thought Police and continual
          surveillance.

          This is the author's epic tale of seven generations of the Buendía
          family that also spans a hundred years of turbulent Latin American
          history, from the postcolonial 1820s to the 1920s. Patriarch José
          Arcadio Buendía builds the utopian city of Macondo in the middle of a
          swamp

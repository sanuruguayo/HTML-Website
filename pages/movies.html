          The streets of Baltimore as a microcosm of the US's war on drugs, and
          of US urban decay in general. Seen not only through the eyes of a few
          policemen and drug gang members but also the people who influence and
          inhabit their world - politicians, the media, drug addicts and
          everyday citizens.
